For the sake of the tutorial, I ended up using VS Studio Code, as I had been unable to download Webstorm. 
VS Studio Code is able to be downloaded off of their website, which follows with a simple installation process that merely requires setting it up. 
From thereon, VS Studio Code can be used by creating a file for programs, and then starting with a program. You can connect VS Studio Code with Github by selecting the 
Github clone repository option, which connects with Github to allow for usage and application of code on multiple devices. 

Branch - Allows user to develop features, fix bugs, etc. without affecting other branches in the repository. In other words, they work as 'containment zones' for programs.
Clone - Cloning merely means copying from Github onto a given machine. 
Commit - Means an individual change to a file, which saves your work.
Fetch - Similarly to cloning, fetching is used to download contents from a remote repository.
GIT - A cloud based control system that allows you to manage and track your source code, and its history.
Github - An online software development platform that hosts repositories.
Merge - A command that allows you to take independent lines of development and integrate them into a single branch.
Merge Conflict - These happen when you merge branches with competing commits. 
Push - Transferring commits from a local repository to a remote one.
Pull - The opposite of push, it pulls from a remote repository to a local one.
Remote - A place where your code is stored.
Repository - A location that contains all of your project's files.
